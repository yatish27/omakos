# Omakos

> Omakos turns your macOS laptop into a fully functional development machine in a single command.
> A shell script to setup a new mac.

Omakos is inspired by Basecamp's [Omakub](https://github.com/basecamp/omakub) project. The name is a combination of "omakase" (お任せ, Japanese for "I leave it up to you") and "macOS", reflecting its purpose of providing a curated development environment setup for macOS.

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely.
It installs, upgrades, or skips packages based on what is already installed on the machine.

## Install

You can install Omakos using one of these two methods:

### Option 1: Direct Install (Recommended)

Run this single command in your terminal:

```sh
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yatish27/omakos/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Option 2: Manual Install

If you prefer to review the code first:

1. Download the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yatish27/omakos.git && cd omakos
```

2. Review the scripts (please don't run scripts you don't understand):

```sh
less setup.sh
```

3. Run the setup:

```sh
./setup.sh 2>&1 | tee ~/omakos.log
```

Just follow the prompts and you'll be fine. 👌

The setup process will install and configure the following tools and applications.

### Enhanced macOS Settings

The setup applies developer-optimized macOS configurations including:

- **Performance**: Near-instant window animations and faster Mission Control
- **Finder**: Opens to home directory, searches current folder by default, shows hidden files
- **Text Editing**: Key repeat enabled in all apps, faster cursor movement
- **Screenshots**: Organized in `~/Desktop/Screenshots/` folder without shadows
- **Trackpad**: Three-finger drag enabled for better window management
- **Keyboard**: Fastest repeat rates for efficient coding
- **System**: Disabled automatic corrections, expanded dialogs, local saves by default

## Features

### Modular Scripts

Each script in the [`scripts/`](scripts/) directory can be run independently:

```sh
# Run individual scripts
./scripts/mac.sh       # Only configure macOS settings
./scripts/git.sh       # Only setup Git configuration
./scripts/cursor.sh    # Only configure Cursor editor
./scripts/nvim.sh      # Only configure Neovim with LazyVim
./scripts/zed.sh       # Only configure Zed editor
./scripts/mise.sh      # Only setup mise and install configured runtimes
./scripts/rubocop.sh   # Only setup Rubocop configuration
./scripts/gemrc.sh     # Only setup Gem configuration
./scripts/zshrc.sh     # Only setup Zsh configuration
./scripts/ssh.sh       # Only configure SSH settings
```

The scripts are designed to be:

- **Independent**: Each script can run on its own
- **Idempotent**: Safe to run multiple times
- **Configurable**: Easy to modify for your needs

## Code Structure

The project follows a modular structure where each component is responsible for a specific setup task. You can run any script individually if you only want to set up specific parts of your system.
