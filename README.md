# ðŸš€ Omakos

> Omakos turns your MacOS laptop into a fully functional development system in a single command.

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely.
It installs, upgrades, or skips packages based on what is already installed on the machine.

## Install

You can install Omakos using one of these two methods:

### Option 1: Direct Install (Recommended)

Run this single command in your terminal:

```sh
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amscad/omakos/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Option 2: Manual Install

If you prefer to review the code first:

1. Download the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/amscad/omakos.git && cd omakos
```

2. Review the scripts (please don't run scripts you don't understand):

```sh
less setup.sh
```

3. Run the setup:

```sh
./setup.sh 2>&1 | tee ~/omakos.log
```

Just follow the prompts and you'll be fine. ðŸ‘Œ

## What it sets up

The setup process will install and configure the following tools and applications.
All packages are managed through Homebrew and defined in [`configs/Brewfile`](configs/Brewfile).

## Features

## Code Structure

The project follows a modular structure where each component is responsible for a specific setup task. You can run any script individually if you only want to set up specific parts of your system.

```
omakos/
â”œâ”€â”€ setup.sh                 # Main setup script
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ascii.sh            # ASCII art for terminal output
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ brew.sh             # Homebrew package installation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cursor_setup.sh     # Cursor editor configuration
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dotfiles_setup.sh   # Dotfiles management
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ git_setup.sh        # Git configuration
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mac_setup.sh        # macOS system preferences
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ssh_setup.sh        # SSH configuration
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils.sh            # Utility functions
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ zsh_setup.sh        # ZSH shell setup
â”œâ”€â”€ configs/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Brewfile            # Homebrew packages list
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cursor/             # Cursor editor settings
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ git/                # Git configuration files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ssh/                # SSH configuration files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ gemrc              # Ruby gems configuration
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ghostty.conf       # Ghostty terminal config
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ rubocop.yml        # Ruby code style config
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

### Modular Scripts

Each script in the [`scripts/`](scripts/) directory can be run independently:

```sh
# Run individual scripts
./scripts/mac_setup.sh     # Only configure macOS settings
./scripts/git_setup.sh     # Only setup Git configuration
./scripts/cursor_setup.sh  # Only configure Cursor editor
```

The scripts are designed to be:

- **Independent**: Each script can run on its own
- **Idempotent**: Safe to run multiple times
- **Configurable**: Easy to modify for your needs

### Configuration Files

The [`configs/`](configs/) directory contains all config files.

## Customization

The script is designed to be customizable. You can:

- Modify the [`Brewfile`](configs/Brewfile) to add/remove packages
- Adjust macOS settings in [`scripts/mac_setup.sh`](scripts/mac_setup.sh)
- Modify the dotfiles in [`configs/`](configs/) directory
